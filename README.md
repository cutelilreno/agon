# Agon
Agon is a simple website backend to fetch scoreboard.dat file from a minecraft server, and then display the rankings on a website. I'm not sure if I will finish this into a polished web app.

## Requirements
You will need a webdav server set up to serve the scoreboard.dat file

## Configuration
This is super barebones and should really been seen as a starting framework. You can configure webdav settings in the webdav.ini file, but move it outside the document root and set the `WEBDAVINI` constant for it's location.
